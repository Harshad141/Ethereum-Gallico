# Hackathon idea: No Scams and Use leisure time wisely
#Problem 

Have to ever got irritated with a time between connecting trains and want to utilize your time to explore the city or want to try a local dish or want to visit places of attraction in the city.

* Virtual assistant UI that shows you a travel plan in the city offering you choices like booking the hotel, cabs, ordering food, flights, movies, places to visit according to the niche(as in teacher, student, child, employee, tourist, etc) as well as books the entry tickets to these places.

*  Minimizes the scam done by local guides to the tourist as it shows the complete travel plan along with the actual money involved.
